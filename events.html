                <p>
                    Raksha Bandhan, commonly known as Rakhi, is a cherished Hindu festival celebrating the bond between brothers and sisters. It typically falls in August on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Shravana. During this festival, sisters tie a sacred thread, or rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, brothers give gifts and pledge to protect their sisters. This ritual reinforces the family bond and mutual respect among siblings. Raksha Bandhan transcends biological relationships, as friends and extended family members also participate, emphasizing the values of love, protection, and unity. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒ¸</p>
